Hi Hailey, 

Here's the URL to my deployed website:
https://damp-mesa-61446.herokuapp.com/news/

SuperUser creds:
Username: petpet
Password: poopiepants

Not many interesting feats to point out I'm afraid:
- Time and Date are automatically set to current when creating a post;
- If user clicks on 'Write a story' while unlogged, they are redirected to login/create and account.
- I think the pairing of fonts Raleway and Bitter works looks pretty cool.

Also:
- You will see some code for media queries in the CSS files but I haven't got around to implementing responsiveness.
- I played with variables in my styles.css for the site and that was a nice thing to learn.

There are screenshots of all pages in /ScreenCaptures.

Thank you for your patience, this has been a pretty hard one to tackle.
I'll DM you if I get to make interesting progress with Django :)
