## Some features

- Time and Date are automatically set to current when creating a post;
- If user clicks on 'Write a story' while unlogged, they are redirected to login/create and account.
- I think the pairing of fonts Raleway and Bitter works looks pretty cool.

Also:
- You will see some code for media queries in the CSS files but I haven't got around to implementing responsiveness.
- I played with variables in my styles.css for the site and that was a nice thing to learn.

There are screenshots of all pages in /ScreenCaptures.
